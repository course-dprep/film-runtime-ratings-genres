# Does Runtime Matter? How Genre Moderates the Impact of Runtime on Audience Ratings

*This project investigates the relationship between a film's runtime and its average audience rating. The main purpose is to determine if an optimal runtime for viewer rating exist and, to examine how genre moderates this relationship. This research uses a large dataset from the IMDb database to empirically test common industry assumptions, such as the belief that audiences award higher ratings to shorter comedies and longer dramas.*

## Motivation

In the highly competitive field of film making, every decision is important, especially when significant financial investments are at stake. Key creative decisions, such as a film's runtime, can influence on how it is received by audiences. This is further complicated by genre, as audience expectations for a quirky comedy differ for a biopic. Audience ratings serve as a direct measure of viewer satisfaction. By analyzing the relationship between runtime, genre, and these ratings, we can move from industry intuition to data-backed insights. This knowledge provides filmmakers and producers with a strategic tool for better aligning their creative ideas with audience preferences, potentially lowering financial risk and increasing a film's success.

Based on this, this study will focus on the following research question:

**To what extent does movie runtime influence average audience ratings, and how does this relationship differ across various film genres?**
