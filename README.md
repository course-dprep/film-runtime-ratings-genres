# Does Run Time Matter? How Genre Moderates the Impact of Run Time on Audience Ratings

*This project investigates the relationship between a film's run time and its average audience rating. The main purpose is to determine if an optimal run time for viewer rating exist and, to examine how genre moderates this relationship. This research uses a large dataset from the IMDb database to empirically test common industry assumptions, such as the belief that audiences award higher ratings to shorter comedies and longer dramas.*
